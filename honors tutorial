#What's the Question?
As you go through the course it can be easy to get caught up in all the technacalities. You can easily become overwhelmed by the scanning, to plain text, to xml process. Don't let your serial question get pushed aside! This is an extremely important aspect of the course, and it must be strong in order for you final analysis to be a success. So, I am going to suggest to you a process for developing a serial question.
1. Read the paper.
..*This sounds silly, but it it very important. Be sure to pay attention to the content in your issue as you are working with the text at different stages. You can't develop a question if you don't know the material.
2. Make note of specific occurrences in the paper that interest you.
..*Actually write it down and note what page it occurs in. You may think that you won't forget these things, but there is a ton of content and you very well might. 
3. Establish a broad area of interest. 
..*Are you more interested in the social aspect? Financial? International? Sports?
4. By week 12, you'll want to have a couple specific questions in mind. 
..*Write these down as well! You'll want to have a place to keep notes about each question in. 
5. Download all available content from you fellow classmates and develop a query.
..*(I will not get into the issue of queries here because that is its own beast.)
6. If there's lots of information on your question in other issues of the paper...great! You probably have a strong serial question. If not, don't panic. 
7. In the case that you can't find much information, try other possibilities. It may even be useful to work backwards. With your broad area of interest in mind, you can skim through some content to see if something inspires a new question. 
8. Establish the most effective query to answer that question and analyze to your heart's content! Be sure to work on your analysis as you go. This will help to accumulate 1500 words more easily.
